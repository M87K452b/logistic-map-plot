## This program computes the logistic map equation.

The logistic map equation is a second degree polynomial equation often used as an example in the discussions of chaos.

### How to:
* Download and run the **lmap-bifirctaion-plot.py** file.
* There are only 2 inputs. xn has a fixed range of 0 to 4. r is the interval and the smaller it is
the more detail is shown in the plot at the expense of computation time.
